## Finviz Top Features Review - My Experience

After upgrading my plan, get access to more advanced tools such as:

### 1. Finding Great Stocks with Screeners

Stock screeners are my go-to tools for discovering promising investments, They give me the ability to filter through thousands of stocks based on specific I mention criteria, and they help me narrow down the best opportunities in seconds.

Many other popular screeners cover 8,500+ major stocks and ETFs, which is a massive selection though not quite the full 10,000+ stocks in the U.S. market.

However, for most traders, that‚Äôs more than enough to find great picks.

How I Filter Stocks:

‚úî Fundamental Metrics ‚Äì Price, market cap, P/E ratio, EPS & revenue growth, debt levels, dividend yield
‚úî Technical Indicators ‚Äì 52-week highs/lows, moving averages, oversold/overbought conditions, chart patterns

The best part? Precision filtering. Whether I‚Äôm looking for undervalued stocks, high-growth companies, or technical breakouts, screeners give me the power to fine-tune my search and spot winning trades with confidence.

### 2. Finviz Heat Map Review

Heat map is one of the best features that I liked the most on the platform, whenever I need the Market mood at a glance, I get it from just looking at the heat map.

![|624x347](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfPmrUB42gz4uCxjwVAGV0nyUwyYMM-TSBbyuu77ki09EM9Hv8yVVSoPtLZ2pLo1hB6_Qhyxl_uUNIalZoAM2c8Ys0UqjJpsT33Nyu2WHqsBymgb2NFMBLOKdEIqkRxk9IOD7CU6Q?key=O7N3j3b6y_XD6j2gLs-049yk)

It always gives me a visual snapshot of stock market performance, making it easy to spot trends at a glance.

By using color-coded signals, red means the sector or the stock is in a downtrend, green means the the sector or stock is in an uptrend.

I was also able to check performance across different regions, using the global stock market heat map, and it shows you data blazingly fast.

Key Insights from Heat Maps:

‚úî Stock Pricing ‚Äì Identify undervalued or overvalued stocks
‚úî Trading Volume ‚Äì Spot where the action is happening
‚úî Dividends ‚Äì See which companies offer the best returns
‚úî Analyst Ratings ‚Äì Gauge expert opinions on stocks

Interestingly, many stocks receive positive analyst ratings, which makes me wonder are these experts overly optimistic.

The real advantage? Instant access to stock details, a simple click opens a deeper dive, allowing me to explore trends and uncover fresh trading ideas effortlessly.

### 3. Stock Sector Performance

The Groups tab is an incredibly useful tool for understanding how different sectors and industries are performing.

It gives me a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the market, helping me identify which areas are heating up and which are cooling down.

One of my favorite things about this tool is the ability to analyze trends over different timeframes, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether I want to look at daily, weekly, or monthly performance, I can quickly spot emerging opportunities.

The real power? Drilling down into individual stocks. Once I see a strong-performing sector, I can zoom in to find specific stocks that align with the trend making it easier to discover high-potential trades.

![|624x464](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfUMtnpUQclkEWEIvvhpIkk5qvw-TTHGRHZpEvEI-eh6agE8lSpkfz5vhQ7ds_ZE5Ed1FkNhe-L8oqlHgsmIt-Q4yGeTlW_7tflP0OLajB_I336LR866y9ivkhEV8NzgbsOj96-uA?key=O7N3j3b6y_XD6j2gLs-049yk)

### 4. Portfolios

If you can't track your investments there is no point in having a financial tool, with Finviz I was easily able to monitor stocks I‚Äôm interested in.

While it‚Äôs not a full portfolio management tool, it‚Äôs a straightforward and effective way to keep tabs on potential trades.

It allows me to save my stocks from searches and organize them into a watchlist, allowing me to track their performance and see the latest news in one place.

It‚Äôs a simple yet powerful feature that helps me stay informed without any clutter.

The best part? Instant updates. Whether I‚Äôm watching a breakout stock or waiting for the right entry point, having all my key stocks in one view makes decision-making faster and easier.

### 5. Crypto and Forex on Finviz

Finviz offers crypto and forex heatmaps, but they‚Äôre pretty basic, with just 15 cryptocurrencies and 12 forex pairs, the selection feels limited.

One useful feature is that the charts are clickable, allowing me to dive deeper into individual assets.

However, I can‚Äôt save notes or customize settings, which makes tracking harder.

The downside? No performance data for cryptos and a bare-bones forex section without news or analysis.

It‚Äôs a decent starting point, but for serious trading, I‚Äôd need more comprehensive insights.

### 6. Charting Tools

Finviz's charting tools are best for technical analysis of a particular stock and it is widely used by technical analysts due to their built-in pattern recognition, overlays, and indicators.

![|624x237](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc3vF9F67k80rsLgW4LLpjlW4HzC2eSRX_ztZniFmMd-hCInsjf3Fw8c58-ws4cfYNoduPbzhNvmzx2i7xW-dU1w6-sycdgrw2Y8PB4l3JbwM2TNjUYWUv1jlITI010rNxOAiPJ?key=O7N3j3b6y_XD6j2gLs-049yk)

The platform automatically identifies common chart patterns like triangles, head and shoulders, flags, and wedges, helping traders spot potential breakout or reversal points.

It shows you indicators like moving averages, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and RSI, which allow users to perform detailed technical analysis.

However, Finviz lacks advanced customization compared to TradingView or ThinkorSwim, but its simplicity and ease of use make it ideal if you want to do a quick market scan.

### 7. News Aggregation

Finviz provides you with real-time financial news from major trusted sources such as Bloomberg, CNBC, Reuters, and MarketWatch.

![|624x287](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXftMATV83Y8ZxsQ9xCI_73TTsUy-eufPeGESt40Z4KQiiSbmdGEVxj2YKruyTUSU1B4PQ2DCHntWLP_0QnI_Dd_HMM0ZsG5EnyLKxNHCf871g-rZtngsNhLbsVlaDoavK11ZjMpZg?key=O7N3j3b6y_XD6j2gLs-049yk)

If you are a fundamental investor this feature is super useful for you and it also caters to news-based traders who need to stay updated on earnings reports, economic data releases, M&A activity, and geopolitical events.

The news feed is integrated within the stock screener, allowing users to quickly correlate news events with stock price movements, helping them make more informed investment decisions.

## Finviz Pros & Cons

For the time being, I have only talked about good things on the Finviz platform, now let me give you a detailed breakdown of the pros and then cons I experienced on the platform, during 2 years of usage.

Pros:

* Comprehensive Screening: The ability to filter stocks based on a multitude of criteria allows for tailored investment strategies.‚Äã

* User-Friendly Interface: Navigating Finviz is intuitive, making it accessible to traders with varying levels of experience.

* Real-Time Data (Elite): Access to real-time data ensures that decisions are based on the most current information available.‚Äã

Cons:

* Limited Customization: While the platform offers a range of tools, some competitors provide more extensive customization options.‚Äã

* No Mobile App: Finviz currently lacks dedicated mobile applications, which may be a drawback for traders who prefer on-the-go access.‚Äã

## How Does It Stack Up?

I had used multiple platforms before finding Finviz as my daily drive for stock market investing, I had used, TrendSpider which is best for automated chart analysis, backtesting, and bot trading.

I also had experience with TradingView, so let‚Äôs see how Finviz stacks against all these platforms in a similar industry.

### Cost Options

Finviz offers both free and premium plans to cater to different user needs:

### 1. Free Version

Finviz's free version provided me access to a wide range of tools initially such as stock screener, heat maps, and news aggregation.

However, Finviz‚Äôs free version comes with a few limitations it does not show you data in real time, which is not ideal for active traders like me.‚Äã

### 2. Elite

After using the Finviz free option, I chose to upgrade to Finviz Elite, which cost me $39.50/month or $299.50/year.

I was able to access more additional features with Finviz Elite subscription such as real-time data, advanced charting, and backtesting capabilities. This plan is suitable for traders seeking more in-depth analysis tools.‚Äã

Let‚Äôs have a clear breakdown between these 2 Finviz pricing plans.

|Finviz Plan|Cost|Features|
| --- | --- | --- |
|No-Cost|Free|Basic stock screening, delayed data|
|Sign-Up|Free|Save settings, 50 portfolios|
|Elite|$24.96-$39.99/mo|Real-time data, alerts, advanced tools|

### Get a Deal on Finviz Elite

When I decided to upgrade my plan from free to Elite, I started looking for [Finviz Discount](https://github.com/Johniereed/Finviz-discount) codes online and I found 50% off.

Which brought down my elite subscription cost to $19.99/month from $39.99/month.

Additionally, you can opt for the annual subscription provides a discount, effectively reducing the monthly cost and offering greater value for long-term users.‚Äã

## The Finviz Experience

My journey on the Finviz platform has been largely positive, I never find any difficulty navigating the website all thanks to its user-friendly design.

The best part is I didn‚Äôt have to download any software, since everything is cloud-based it offered me exceptional speed with robust security.

Every time when I want to look at my Finviz dashboard, I just have to open my laptop‚Äôs browser and the program fires up.‚Äã

### Is Finviz Simple to Work With?

In my experience, I found Finviz incredibly beginner-friendly.

The layout is intuitive, and most features are accessible within a few clicks, the stock screener, in particular, is easy to use, allowing traders to filter stocks based on various criteria without a steep learning curve.

### Is Finviz a Good Deal?

Absolutely! The free version alone provides significant value with its stock screener, heat maps, and news aggregation.

However, if you're a serious trader who needs real-time data and backtesting capabilities, upgrading to Finviz Elite is well worth the investment.

### Is Finviz Elite a Good Investment?

If you are a serious trader or investor looking for real-time updates, advanced charting, and a powerful backtesting tool, Finviz Elite is definitely worth the price.

At $39.50 per month (or $299.50 annually), it provides advanced features that can enhance your market analysis and trading strategies.

Compared to other premium stock screening tools, Finviz Elite offers a competitive pricing structure with robust features.

## Finviz Alternatives

While Finviz is an excellent tool, it‚Äôs always good to explore alternatives to ensure you‚Äôre using the best platform for your needs.

Here are a few options I‚Äôve tried:

1. TradingView ‚Äì A great alternative for technical analysis with a focus on interactive charts and real-time data.
2. TC2000 ‚Äì Offers strong charting capabilities and excellent scanning tools but at a higher price point.
3. Yahoo Finance Premium ‚Äì A solid choice for fundamental analysis and portfolio tracking.
4. Stock Rover ‚Äì Best suited for long-term investors looking for in-depth fundamental data.

Each platform has its strengths, but Finviz remains my go-to for quick market analysis, stock screening, and heat maps.

## Conclusion - Finviz Elite Review 2025 | Is It Worth It?

After two years of using Finviz, I can confidently say that it is one of the best stock market screening tools available.

It is suitable for both beginner and experienced traders, Finviz offers a powerful suite of tools that simplify market analysis.
